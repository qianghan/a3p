# AgentBook — MVP Implementation Plan for A3P

> **Governing documents:** This plan MUST be implemented in compliance with:
> - `architecture.md` — Component design, quality system, data architecture
> - `SKILL.md` — Code patterns, constraints, testing standards, LLM prompt standards
> - `requirements-v2.md` — Feature requirements, competitive positioning, acceptance criteria
> - `phased-plan.md` — Phase sequencing, exit criteria, risk register

---

## Overview

AgentBook is an agent-based accounting system implemented as a set of A3P plugins. Rather than a single monolithic plugin, the MVP is decomposed into **four cooperating plugins** that map to the core accounting domains, plus an **agent framework** with a decoupled **skill system** that allows the agent to be upgraded by improving skills without changing the framework.

**The MVP ships with full support for the United States and Canada.** The architecture is jurisdiction-aware from day one so that adding new countries (UK, EU, Australia, etc.) requires only a new **jurisdiction pack** — a bundle of tax rules, chart-of-accounts templates, form generators, and locale config — with zero changes to the core framework, plugins, or database schema.

This approach lets each domain evolve independently, enables granular permissions, and follows the A3P plugin-per-domain architecture principle.

## Core Design Philosophy: Your 24/7 Accounting Firm

> **AgentBook is not a tool you use. It is a professional that works for you.**
>
> A great accounting firm doesn't wait for you to call. It monitors your bank activity, flags unusual charges, reminds you about upcoming deadlines, hunts for tax savings, follows up on overdue invoices, and surfaces insights you didn't know to ask for. AgentBook does the same — proactively, around the clock, via Telegram messages that feel like a thoughtful partner checking in.
>
> **The architecture has two equal halves:**
> 1. **Reactive path** — user sends a receipt, asks a question, requests a report. Agent responds.
> 2. **Proactive path** — agent monitors data, detects opportunities/risks, initiates contact. User responds (or ignores).
>
> Both paths use the same skill system, constraint engine, and verification pipeline. The proactive path is not a bolt-on — it is a **first-class architectural component** built from Phase 0.

## Agent Architecture: Framework + Skills (Decoupled)

### Design Principle
The agent framework is a **generic orchestration engine** with two execution modes: **reactive** (responding to user messages) and **proactive** (self-initiated based on schedules, events, and data analysis). All domain knowledge lives in **loadable, updatable skills**. The system can be iterated/upgraded by improving agent skills without changing the agent framework.

### Agent Framework (stable, rarely changes)
```
AgentFramework/
  ├── orchestrator.ts        # Intent routing, DAG planning, execution loop
  ├── constraint-engine.ts   # Hard gates, escalation gates, soft checks
  ├── verifier.ts            # Independent verification pass
  ├── context-assembler.ts   # Typed context loading per intent
  ├── escalation-router.ts   # Human-in-the-loop routing
  ├── skill-registry.ts      # Discovers, loads, validates, hot-reloads skills
  ├── event-emitter.ts       # Kafka event emission
  └── proactive-engine.ts    # Scheduled + event-driven proactive engagement
```

### Proactive Engagement Engine (the differentiator)

This is the component that makes AgentBook feel like a professional firm, not a passive app. It runs continuously alongside the reactive path.

**Architecture:**
```
ProactiveEngine/
  ├── scheduler.ts           # Cron-based triggers (daily digest, weekly review, deadline reminders)
  ├── event-watcher.ts       # Kafka consumer: reacts to data changes in real-time
  ├── insight-generator.ts   # LLM-powered analysis: detects opportunities, risks, anomalies
  ├── priority-ranker.ts     # Ranks insights by urgency/value to avoid notification fatigue
  ├── delivery-manager.ts    # Routes notifications: Telegram, web dashboard, email digest
  └── engagement-tracker.ts  # Tracks which notifications user acts on (feedback loop for relevance)
```

**Four trigger types:**

| Trigger | Example | Mechanism |
|---------|---------|-----------|
| **Scheduled** | Weekly financial summary, daily pulse | Cron job per tenant (timezone-aware) |
| **Calendar-driven** | Tax deadline, fiscal quarter close, year-end | Calendar & Deadline Engine (see below) |
| **Event-driven** | Payment received, bank transaction imported, invoice overdue | Kafka consumer on `agentbooks.execution_events` |
| **Analysis-driven** | Cash flow warning, deduction opportunity, spending anomaly | Periodic LLM analysis of tenant ledger data |

### Calendar & Deadline Engine (always on the clock)

The agent maintains a **living calendar** of every date that matters for each tenant's financial life. This is not a static config or hardcoded reminder list — deadlines, holidays, and critical dates are **discovered and populated by skills and tools**, the same way the agent learns everything else. Skills can add, update, and remove calendar events dynamically as data changes.

**Calendar is populated by skills (not config):**

Each skill that knows about dates registers a `CalendarProvider` tool. The calendar engine calls all registered providers periodically and on relevant events to keep the calendar current.

```typescript
// Skills register calendar providers — the engine discovers dates via tools, not config
interface CalendarProvider {
  name: string;                    // "us-tax-deadlines" | "invoice-due-dates" | "pattern-renewals"
  skill: string;                   // which skill owns this provider
  getEvents(tenant: TenantContext, dateRange: DateRange): CalendarEvent[];
}

// The jurisdiction pack skill registers its calendar provider
// Example: US pack's tax deadline skill
{
  "name": "us-tax-calendar",
  "skill": "jurisdiction-us",
  "tool": "get_tax_deadlines",     // standard tool interface, callable like any other tool
  "refresh": "daily"               // how often the engine re-queries this provider
}
```

**Skill-provided calendar sources:**

| Skill | Events Provided | Refresh |
|-------|----------------|---------|
| **jurisdiction-us** (tax deadline tool) | Apr 15 annual, Jun/Sep/Jan quarterly, Jan 31 1099 filing, state-specific deadlines | Daily + on tax year change |
| **jurisdiction-ca** (tax deadline tool) | Apr 30 annual, Mar/Jun/Sep/Dec installments, Feb 28 T4A, RRSP deadline Mar 1 | Daily + on tax year change |
| **jurisdiction-{x}** (sales tax tool) | Sales tax filing deadlines per state/province | Daily |
| **invoice-creation** (due date tool) | All outstanding invoice due dates, projected payment dates from client patterns | On invoice create/pay/edit |
| **expense-recording** (recurring tool) | Subscription renewal dates, recurring charge expected dates | On pattern detection |
| **bank-reconciliation** (cash flow tool) | Projected dates where balance drops below threshold | On bank sync |
| **market-calendar** skill | Bank holidays (Fed Reserve / Bank of Canada), Stripe payout schedule, market close dates | Weekly sync from public APIs |
| **seasonal-awareness** skill | Tax season (Feb-Apr), year-end planning (Nov), RRSP season (Jan-Mar for CA) | Annual seed |

**Why skills, not config:**
- A new jurisdiction pack automatically brings its deadlines — no manual calendar setup
- When an invoice is created, the invoice skill adds the due date — no separate reminder system
- When a recurring pattern is detected, the expense skill projects the next date — the calendar self-maintains
- When market holidays change, the market-calendar skill fetches updated data — no code deploys
- Custom user dates ("remind me to invoice Acme on the 1st of each month") are just another skill adding events

**Calendar event model:**
```
ab_calendar_events (
  id, tenant_id,
  event_type,                    -- tax_deadline | filing_deadline | quarter_close | market_holiday | invoice_due | renewal | cash_crunch | custom
  title_key,                     -- i18n key: "calendar.q2_estimated_tax_due"
  date, time,
  lead_time_days,                -- when to start alerting (e.g., [7, 3, 1, 0] = alert at 7d, 3d, 1d, day-of)
  urgency,                       -- critical | important | informational
  action_url,                    -- deep link: IRS Direct Pay, CRA My Account, etc.
  action_label_key,              -- i18n key: "calendar.action_pay_now"
  recurrence,                    -- annual | quarterly | monthly | once
  source_skill,                  -- which skill created this event
  source_entity_id,              -- invoice_id, pattern_id, etc. (for updates/deletes)
  status                         -- upcoming | alerted | acted_on | missed | snoozed
)
```

**How it works:**
1. On tenant onboarding, the jurisdiction pack skill's `get_tax_deadlines` tool is called — seeds all government deadlines
2. As invoices are created, the invoice skill's calendar provider adds due dates
3. As patterns are detected, the expense skill projects renewal/charge dates
4. As bank data flows, the cash flow skill calculates crunch dates
5. The proactive engine queries the calendar every hour, fires alerts at configured lead times
6. New tax year -> jurisdiction skill auto-seeds next year's deadlines via the same tool
7. If a skill is updated (new deadline added to jurisdiction pack), the calendar self-updates on next refresh

**Proactive message categories (what the agent initiates):**

| Category | Phase | Examples |
|----------|-------|---------|
| **Money in** | 0 | "Acme Corp just paid $5,000! Net after Stripe fees: $4,854.50." |
| **Money out alerts** | 0 | "Unusual charge: $847 at Best Buy. Office supplies? [Yes] [No] [Split]" |
| **Receipt reminders** | 0 | "You have 3 bank transactions this week without receipts. Want to snap them now?" |
| **Daily pulse** | 0 | "Today: $340 in, $127 out. Cash balance: $12,450. 1 invoice due tomorrow." |
| **Invoice follow-up** | 1 | "Acme Corp is 7 days overdue on $5,000. Want me to send a reminder? [Send] [Wait] [Call instead]" |
| **Recurring anomaly** | 1 | "Your Figma subscription charged $59.99 instead of the usual $49.99. Price increase? [Accept new amount] [Investigate]" |
| **Tax deadline** | 2 | "Quarterly tax payment due in 7 days. I calculated $3,200 for Q2. [Pay now via IRS Direct Pay] [Adjust] [Remind me in 3 days]" |
| **Deduction hunting** | 2 | "You haven't logged home office expenses this year. Do you work from home? You could save ~$1,500 in taxes." |
| **Cash flow warning** | 3 | "Heads up: your cash balance drops to $1,200 on April 3. You have $3,800 in bills but only $2,600 expected income. Follow up on overdue Acme invoice?" |
| **Tax bracket alert** | 3 | "You're $3,000 from the next bracket. If you can prepay January rent or buy that equipment, you'd save ~$660." |
| **Weekly review** | 1 | "This week: $4,200 revenue, $1,340 expenses. Top spend: Software ($420). Your effective tax rate is 28.3%." |
| **Year-end planning** | 4 | "It's November. Here's your year-end tax optimization report: 4 actions could save $2,840. [View report]" |

**Anti-annoyance design:**
- Priority ranking: urgent (tax deadline) > actionable (invoice reminder) > informational (weekly digest)
- User preference learning: if user ignores expense analytics alerts 3x, reduce frequency
- Quiet hours: respect tenant timezone, no messages before 8am or after 9pm
- Consolidation: batch low-priority insights into daily/weekly digest, don't send 10 separate messages
- One-tap actions: every proactive message has inline keyboard buttons — the user should never need to type a response
- Snooze: [Remind me tomorrow] [Remind me next week] [Don't remind me about this]

**Engagement tracking (feedback loop):**
```
ab_engagement_log (
  id, tenant_id, message_type, category, priority,
  sent_at, opened_at, acted_on_at, action_taken,
  snoozed, dismissed, response_time_seconds
)
```
The engine learns: "This tenant acts on invoice reminders within 2 hours but ignores spending anomaly alerts. Increase invoice reminder priority, reduce anomaly alert frequency."

## Internationalization (i18n) — Built Into the Core

### Design Principle
Every string the user sees — Telegram messages, web dashboard labels, proactive alerts, PDF reports, error messages, inline keyboard buttons — goes through the i18n layer. **No hardcoded English strings in business logic or UI components.** This is enforced from Phase 0, not retrofitted later.

### Architecture
```
i18n/
  ├── core.ts                  # i18n runtime: t() function, locale resolution, pluralization
  ├── locales/
  │   ├── en/                  # English (default)
  │   │   ├── common.json      # Shared: buttons, labels, errors, units
  │   │   ├── expense.json     # "Receipt saved", "Category: {category}", etc.
  │   │   ├── invoice.json     # "Invoice #{number} sent to {client}"
  │   │   ├── tax.json         # "Quarterly tax due: {amount}", "Deduction found: {description}"
  │   │   ├── proactive.json   # "Daily pulse: {in} in, {out} out", "Acme is {days} days overdue"
  │   │   └── reports.json     # P&L headers, balance sheet labels, column names
  │   ├── fr/                  # French (Canadian French for MVP)
  │   │   ├── common.json
  │   │   ├── expense.json
  │   │   └── ...
  │   └── _template/           # Copy to add a new language
  │       └── README.md
  ├── types.ts                 # TypeScript type-safe i18n keys (compile-time checking)
  └── middleware.ts             # Resolves locale from tenant config for every request
```

### How it works

**1. Every user-facing string uses a translation key:**
```typescript
// WRONG — hardcoded string
await telegram.send("Receipt saved. Journal entry posted.");

// CORRECT — i18n key with interpolation
await telegram.send(t('expense.receipt_saved', { amount: formatCurrency(4500, locale) }));
// en: "Receipt saved. $45.00 recorded."
// fr: "Recu enregistre. 45,00 $ enregistre."
```

**2. Currency, date, and number formatting is locale-aware:**
```typescript
formatCurrency(4500, 'en-US')  // "$45.00"
formatCurrency(4500, 'en-CA')  // "$45.00"  (CAD symbol same, but context differs)
formatCurrency(4500, 'fr-CA')  // "45,00 $"  (comma decimal, symbol after)

formatDate(date, 'en-US')      // "Mar 22, 2026"
formatDate(date, 'fr-CA')      // "22 mars 2026"

formatNumber(1234.56, 'en')    // "1,234.56"
formatNumber(1234.56, 'fr')    // "1 234,56"
```

**3. Telegram inline keyboard buttons are i18n'd:**
```typescript
// Buttons use translation keys
const keyboard = [
  [{ text: t('common.correct'), callback_data: 'confirm' }],
  [{ text: t('expense.change_category'), callback_data: 'change_cat' }],
  [{ text: t('expense.mark_personal'), callback_data: 'personal' }],
];
// en: [Correct] [Change category] [Mark personal]
// fr: [Correct] [Changer la categorie] [Marquer personnel]
```

**4. PDF reports and tax forms use locale-aware templates:**
- Invoice PDFs: locale determines date format, currency format, column headers
- P&L reports: account names from jurisdiction pack (already localized), column labels from i18n
- Tax forms: generated by jurisdiction pack which includes locale-specific field labels

**5. Proactive messages are fully i18n'd:**
```json
// proactive.json (en)
{
  "daily_pulse": "Today: {income} in, {expenses} out. Cash balance: {balance}. {action_count} items need attention.",
  "invoice_overdue": "{client} is {days} days overdue on {amount}. Send a reminder?",
  "tax_deadline": "Quarterly tax payment due in {days} days. I calculated {amount} for {quarter}."
}

// proactive.json (fr)
{
  "daily_pulse": "Aujourd'hui : {income} entrant, {expenses} sortant. Solde : {balance}. {action_count} elements necessitent votre attention.",
  "invoice_overdue": "{client} a {days} jours de retard sur {amount}. Envoyer un rappel ?",
  "tax_deadline": "Paiement d'impot trimestriel du dans {days} jours. J'ai calcule {amount} pour {quarter}."
}
```

**6. Locale resolution chain:**
1. Tenant config `locale` field (e.g., `fr-CA`) — primary
2. User browser `Accept-Language` header — fallback for web
3. Telegram user `language_code` — fallback for Telegram
4. Default: `en`

### MVP languages
- **`en`** — English (US + CA, default)
- **`fr`** — French (Canadian French, for Quebec users)

### Adding a new language
1. Copy `i18n/locales/_template/` to `i18n/locales/{lang}/`
2. Translate all JSON files (can be LLM-assisted with human review)
3. Register in locale config
4. No code changes — the i18n runtime discovers new locales automatically

### Compile-time safety
TypeScript types are auto-generated from the `en` locale files. If a translation key is missing in any locale, the build warns. If code references a non-existent key, it fails at compile time.

### Skill Lifecycle
- **Discovery:** Framework scans `skills/` directory on startup
- **Validation:** Each skill manifest is validated against the skill schema
- **Registration:** Tools, constraints, and prompts registered in the skill registry
- **Hot-reload:** Skills can be updated at runtime without restarting the framework
- **Versioning:** Multiple skill versions can coexist; A/B testing supported
- **Specialization:** New accounting specializations (e.g., Canadian tax, EU VAT, crypto) are added as new skills, not framework changes

## Multi-Jurisdiction Architecture (US + Canada, extensible)

### Design Principle
Every component that touches tax rules, form generation, chart-of-accounts defaults, sales tax, fiscal year conventions, or locale formatting is **parameterized by jurisdiction**. The core framework and plugins never contain hardcoded US or Canadian logic — they delegate to a **jurisdiction pack** loaded at tenant configuration time.

### What varies by jurisdiction

| Concern | US | Canada | Abstraction |
|---------|-----|--------|-------------|
| Income tax form | Schedule C (1040) | T2125 (T1) | `TaxFormGenerator` interface |
| Self-employment tax | SE tax (15.3%) | CPP/EI self-employed contributions | `SelfEmploymentTaxCalculator` interface |
| Tax brackets | Federal + state progressive | Federal + provincial progressive | `TaxBracketProvider` with year-versioned rates |
| Quarterly installments | Estimated tax (Apr/Jun/Sep/Jan) | Quarterly installments (Mar/Jun/Sep/Dec) | `InstallmentSchedule` interface |
| Sales tax | State/county/city sales tax | GST (5%) + HST or PST by province | `SalesTaxEngine` interface |
| Contractor reporting | 1099-NEC ($600 threshold) | T4A ($500 threshold) | `ContractorReportGenerator` interface |
| Chart of accounts defaults | Schedule C line-aligned | T2125 category-aligned | `ChartOfAccountsTemplate` per jurisdiction |
| Currency | USD | CAD | `tenant_config.currency` + multi-currency amounts |
| Fiscal year | Calendar year (most sole props) | Calendar year (most sole props) | `tenant_config.fiscal_year_start` |
| Mileage rate | IRS standard ($0.70/mile 2025) | CRA rate ($0.72/km first 5000, $0.66 after) | `MileageRateProvider` with year-versioned rates |
| Receipt language | English | English + French | `locale` on tenant config |
| Deduction categories | Home office (simplified/regular), Section 179 | Business-use-of-home, CCA classes | `DeductionRuleSet` per jurisdiction |

### Jurisdiction Pack Structure

A jurisdiction pack is a **skill bundle** that plugs into the agent's skill registry. Adding a new country = adding a new pack. No framework or plugin changes required.

```

      └── README.md              # Instructions for implementing each interface
```

### Jurisdiction Interfaces (implemented by each pack)

```typescript
// Every interface is parameterized by tax_year for annual rate updates

interface TaxBracketProvider {
  jurisdiction: string;              // "us" | "ca" | "uk" | ...
  region?: string;                   // state/province/nil
  getTaxBrackets(taxYear: number): TaxBracket[];
  calculateTax(taxableIncome: number, taxYear: number): TaxCalculation;
}

interface SelfEmploymentTaxCalculator {
  calculate(netSelfEmploymentIncome: number, taxYear: number): {
    amount: number;
    deductiblePortion: number;      // US: half of SE tax; CA: enhanced CPP
    breakdown: Record<string, number>;
  };
}

interface SalesTaxEngine {
  getRates(region: string): SalesTaxRate[];
  calculateTax(amount: number, region: string): SalesTaxResult;
  getFilingDeadlines(region: string, taxYear: number): Date[];
}

interface TaxFormGenerator {
  formId: string;                    // "schedule-c" | "t2125" | ...
  generate(ledgerData: LedgerSummary, taxYear: number): TaxFormData;
  exportPDF(formData: TaxFormData): Buffer;
  exportMachineReadable(formData: TaxFormData): string; // TXF, EFILE, etc.
}

interface InstallmentSchedule {
  getDeadlines(taxYear: number): InstallmentDeadline[];
  calculateAmount(method: string, yearToDateIncome: number, priorYearTax: number): number;
}

interface ContractorReportGenerator {
  threshold: number;                 // US: 600, CA: 500
  formId: string;                    // "1099-nec" | "t4a"
  generate(contractorPayments: ContractorPayment[], taxYear: number): ContractorReport[];
}

interface ChartOfAccountsTemplate {
  getDefaultAccounts(businessType: string): Account[];
  getTaxCategoryMapping(): Record<string, string>; // account -> tax form line
}

interface MileageRateProvider {
  getRate(taxYear: number, totalKmOrMiles: number): { rate: number; unit: 'mile' | 'km' };
}

interface DeductionRuleSet {
  getAvailableDeductions(businessType: string): DeductionRule[];
  calculateDeduction(rule: string, inputs: Record<string, number>): number;
}
```

### How it works at runtime

1. **Tenant onboarding:** User selects country + region (state/province). Stored in `ab_tenant_config.jurisdiction` and `ab_tenant_config.region`.
2. **Pack loading:** The skill registry loads the jurisdiction pack matching the tenant's config. All tax/form/sales-tax interfaces resolve to the pack's implementations.
3. **Core plugins are jurisdiction-agnostic:** `agentbook-core` stores journal entries, chart of accounts, and amounts in cents. It never references Schedule C, T2125, GST, or any jurisdiction-specific concept.
4. **Tax plugin delegates:** `agentbook-tax` calls `TaxBracketProvider.calculateTax()`, `SelfEmploymentTaxCalculator.calculate()`, etc. It doesn't know whether it's computing IRS or CRA taxes.
5. **Adding a new country:** Implement the interfaces in a new pack directory. Register it. Done. Zero changes to framework, plugins, or schema.

### Multi-currency support

- All amounts stored as integer cents in the **tenant's base currency** (USD or CAD for MVP).
- Foreign currency transactions store both `amount_cents` (base) and `original_amount_cents` + `original_currency` + `exchange_rate`.
- Exchange rates fetched at transaction date from a rate provider.
- Reports always display in tenant base currency; drill-down shows original currency.
- Adding a new base currency = adding a currency config, not a schema change.

### What is NOT jurisdiction-specific (shared across all countries)

- Double-entry ledger mechanics (debits = credits is universal)
- Receipt OCR and expense categorization (LLM-based, locale-aware prompts)
- Invoice creation and PDF generation (template uses tenant locale/currency)
- Bank connection via Plaid (supports US + Canada natively)
- Stripe payment processing (supports both countries)
- Pattern memory and learning
- Agent framework, skill registry, constraint engine, verification pass
- Audit trail and event sourcing
- Dashboard UI (renders jurisdiction-specific data via the pack)

## Plugin Decomposition

### 1. `agentbook-core` — Ledger & Chart of Accounts
**Purpose:** The financial backbone. Double-entry ledger, chart of accounts, journal entries, tenant configuration, and the constraint engine that enforces accounting invariants. **Jurisdiction-agnostic** — all country-specific logic lives in jurisdiction packs.

**Key tools:**
- `create_journal_entry` — balanced debit/credit entry (hard-gated: sum(debits) == sum(credits))
- `get_trial_balance` — real-time trial balance
- `manage_chart_of_accounts` — CRUD for accounts (defaults loaded from jurisdiction pack's `ChartOfAccountsTemplate`)
- `close_period` / `open_period` — fiscal period management

**Database schema:** `plugin_agentbook_core`
- `ab_accounts` (chart of accounts — structure is universal, default categories from jurisdiction pack)
- `ab_journal_entries` (header: date, memo, source, verified)
- `ab_journal_lines` (entry_id, account_id, debit_cents, credit_cents)
- `ab_fiscal_periods` (year, month, status: open/closed)
- `ab_tenant_config` (business_type, **jurisdiction** [us|ca|...], **region** [state|province], **currency** [USD|CAD|...], locale, auto_approve_limit)

**Constraints (programmatic, never LLM — per SKILL.md):**
- Balance invariant: `CHECK (debit_total = credit_total)` at DB level
- Period gate: reject entries to closed periods
- Amount threshold: escalate if amount > tenant auto-approve limit

**Routes:** `/agentbook`, `/agentbook/ledger`, `/agentbook/accounts`

---

### 2. `agentbook-expense` — Expense Tracking & Categorization
**Purpose:** Capture, categorize, and manage expenses. Receipt OCR, auto-categorization with confidence scoring, recurring expense detection, business/personal separation.

**Key tools:**
- `record_expense` — create expense from text, photo, or forwarded receipt
- `categorize_expense` — LLM-based categorization against chart of accounts
- `detect_recurring` — background pattern detection on expense stream
- `manage_vendors` — vendor memory and per-vendor category rules

**Database schema:** `plugin_agentbook_expense`
- `ab_expenses` (amount_cents, vendor_id, category_id, date, receipt_url, confidence, is_personal)
- `ab_vendors` (name, normalized_name, default_category_id, transaction_count)
- `ab_patterns` (vendor_pattern, category_id, confidence, source, usage_count)
- `ab_recurring_rules` (vendor_id, amount_cents, frequency, next_expected, active)

**Integration with core:** Every recorded expense triggers a journal entry via `agentbook-core.create_journal_entry` (debit: expense account, credit: cash/bank account).

**Routes:** `/agentbook/expenses`, `/agentbook/receipts`, `/agentbook/vendors`

---

### 3. `agentbook-invoice` — Invoicing & Accounts Receivable
**Purpose:** Create, send, and track invoices. Payment collection via Stripe. Client management. Payment follow-up automation.

**Key tools:**
- `create_invoice` — natural language -> structured invoice -> PDF
- `send_invoice` — email delivery with payment link
- `record_payment` — manual or Stripe webhook payment recording
- `manage_clients` — client records with payment pattern learning
- `get_aging_report` — AR aging (current, 30, 60, 90+ days)

**Database schema:** `plugin_agentbook_invoice`
- `ab_clients` (name, email, address, default_terms, avg_days_to_pay)
- `ab_invoices` (client_id, number, amount_cents, issued_date, due_date, status, pdf_url)
- `ab_invoice_lines` (invoice_id, description, quantity, rate_cents, amount_cents)
- `ab_payments` (invoice_id, amount_cents, method, date, stripe_payment_id, fees_cents)
- `ab_estimates` (client_id, amount_cents, status, validity_period)

**Integration with core:** Invoice creation -> journal entry (debit: AR, credit: revenue). Payment -> journal entry (debit: cash, credit: AR; debit: fees expense, credit: cash).

**Routes:** `/agentbook/invoices`, `/agentbook/clients`, `/agentbook/estimates`

---

### 4. `agentbook-tax` — Tax Planning & Reporting
**Purpose:** Real-time tax estimation, quarterly payment management, deduction optimization, tax form generation, and financial reporting (P&L, balance sheet, cash flow). **All tax logic delegates to the tenant's jurisdiction pack** — the plugin itself is jurisdiction-agnostic.

**Key tools:**
- `estimate_tax` — calls `TaxBracketProvider` + `SelfEmploymentTaxCalculator` from jurisdiction pack
- `suggest_deductions` — calls `DeductionRuleSet` from jurisdiction pack for gap analysis
- `calculate_quarterly` — calls `InstallmentSchedule` from jurisdiction pack
- `generate_tax_forms` — calls `TaxFormGenerator` from jurisdiction pack (Schedule C for US, T2125 for CA)
- `generate_report` — P&L, balance sheet, cash flow (universal, not jurisdiction-specific)
- `project_cash_flow` — 30/60/90 day forecast
- `calculate_sales_tax` — calls `SalesTaxEngine` from jurisdiction pack (state tax for US, GST/HST/PST for CA)

**Database schema:** `plugin_agentbook_tax`
- `ab_tax_estimates` (period, jurisdiction, region, gross_revenue_cents, expenses_cents, net_income_cents, se_tax_cents, income_tax_cents, total_cents)
- `ab_quarterly_payments` (year, quarter, jurisdiction, amount_due_cents, amount_paid_cents, deadline)
- `ab_deduction_suggestions` (jurisdiction, category, description, estimated_savings_cents, status)
- `ab_tax_config` (filing_status, region, retirement_type, home_office_method)
- `ab_sales_tax_collected` (invoice_id, jurisdiction, region, tax_type [GST|HST|PST|state], rate, amount_cents)

**Integration with core:** Reads ledger data from `agentbook-core` for all calculations. No direct writes to ledger.

**Routes:** `/agentbook/tax`, `/agentbook/reports`, `/agentbook/cashflow`

## Cross-Plugin Communication

Plugins communicate through the A3P event bus and direct tool invocation:

```
Telegram / Web Dashboard
    |
    v
Interface Layer (Telegram bot / Web API)
    |
    +-- Text message: "I spent $45 on lunch"
    |   -> Agent Framework -> skill:expense-recording.record_expense()
    |   -> agentbook-core.create_journal_entry()
    |
    +-- Photo message: [receipt image]
    |   -> Agent Framework -> skill:receipt-ocr.extract_receipt()
    |   -> { amount: 4500, vendor: "Subway", date: "2026-03-22" }
    |   -> skill:expense-recording.record_expense()
    |   -> Telegram: inline keyboard [Correct] [Change] [Edit] [Personal]
    |   -> on confirm: agentbook-core.create_journal_entry()
    |   -> receipt image stored in S3, linked to expense
    |
    +-- Document: [forwarded email receipt / PDF]
    |   -> Agent Framework -> skill:receipt-ocr.extract_document()
    |   -> same flow as photo
    |
    +-- "Invoice Acme $5,000"
    |   -> skill:invoice-creation.create_invoice()
    |   -> agentbook-core.create_journal_entry()
    |
    +-- "What's my tax situation?"
    |   -> skill:tax-estimation.estimate_tax()
    |   -> reads from agentbook-core ledger
    |
    +-- "Show me my P&L"
        -> skill:report-generation.generate_report()
        -> reads from agentbook-core ledger
```

**Event flow:**
- `expense.recorded` -> tax plugin recalculates estimate
- `receipt.uploaded` -> OCR pipeline triggered, expense created on completion
- `invoice.paid` -> core plugin records journal entry -> tax recalculates
- `period.closed` -> expense plugin stops accepting entries for that period

## Phase 0: Foundation (2 weeks)

**Goal:** Plugin scaffolds, agent framework with skill system, ledger database, **Telegram bot with receipt photo capture and OCR** — so users experience the magic from day one.

> **UX-first principle:** The core differentiator of AgentBook is "snap a receipt, done." This must work in Phase 0, not be deferred. A text-only Phase 0 would feel no different from a spreadsheet. The photo-to-expense flow is what makes first-time users say "wow."

## Technical Decisions

### All amounts stored as integer cents
No floating-point in the financial path. `$45.99` -> `4599`. Rounding applied only at display. Per SKILL.md: "all financial calculations use Decimal (not float), rounded to 2 decimal places."

### Constraint engine is code, not prompts
The LLM proposes; the constraint engine validates. Per SKILL.md: "Never put accounting constraints inside LLM prompts as instructions. Constraints are code, not text."

### Verification is a separate pass
Per architecture.md: "The executor and the verifier are separate reasoning passes with separate prompts." The verifier's prompt is adversarial: "Your job is to find errors."

### Plugin-specific Prisma schemas
Each plugin owns its own PostgreSQL schema for clean isolation while sharing the same database.

### Agent framework / skill decoupling
The agent framework is generic orchestration. All domain knowledge lives in skills. Skills are versioned, hot-reloadable, and independently testable. IRS rate changes = skill update, not framework change.

### LLM via Service Gateway (configurable, not hardcoded)
AgentBook does NOT directly call LLM provider APIs. All LLM calls route through the A3P **service-gateway** plugin, which provides:
- **Configurable LLM backend:** tenant or platform admin can switch between Claude, GPT, open-source models, or self-hosted inference — without changing AgentBook code
- **Model tier routing:** skill manifests declare `modelTier: "haiku" | "sonnet" | "opus"`. The service gateway maps tiers to concrete models based on its connector configuration
- **API key management:** LLM provider keys stored in service-gateway's secret vault, never in AgentBook plugins
- **Cost tracking:** service-gateway meters per-request token usage, enabling per-tenant cost budgets
- **Fallback chain:** if primary provider is down, gateway can failover to secondary (e.g., Claude -> GPT -> local)
- **Rate limiting:** gateway enforces per-tenant LLM call budgets to prevent runaway costs

```typescript
// AgentBook skill calls LLM via service-gateway, never directly
const response = await gateway.llm({
  tier: 'haiku',                    // mapped to concrete model by gateway config
  tenant_id: context.tenant_id,
  prompt: categorization_prompt,
  max_tokens: 200,
});
```

**LLM cost budget target:** < $5/month per active tenant at 100 transactions/month (Haiku for parsing/categorization, Sonnet for planning/verification).
